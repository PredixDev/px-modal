v3.3.4
==================
* Improve looking up for focusable elements inside the modal

v3.3.3
==================
* Add `disableAutoFocus` property. When set to `true` the modal will not attempt
  to focus the first focusable element in its slots or shadow root.

v3.3.2
==================
* Hide box completely when modal is not shown to avoid interactions

v3.3.1
==================
* Check if event target is disabled before dismissing modal

v3.3.0
==================
* Added --px-modal-z-index css var
* Updated default to 1200 to follow our new z-index guidelines

v3.2.4
==================
* fixing demo pages for IE11

v3.2.3
==================
* Don't dismiss the modal when click events fire from trigger containers.
  This fixes a bug where the modal may be dismissed if the user clicks on a
  button with the `disabled` attribute and the CSS rule `pointerevents: none`,
  which triggers the event listener on the trigger container even when the
  button should not be clickable.

v3.2.2
==================
* Add temporary fix for bug where overflowed content is hidden in the
  non-mobile style modal

v3.2.1
==================
* add refit on open

==================
* Add `actions` slot to allow developer to define custom action buttons or text
  inline with the reject and accept triggers

v3.1.5
==================
* fix documentation slightly

v3.1.4
==================
* fix demo on mobile (#29)

v3.1.3
==================
* add missing iron-fit dep (#26)

v3.1.2
==================
* oops, reverting demo

v3.1.1
==================
* fix overflow for custom content use cases

v3.1.0
==================
* added the fill-container property and iron-fit-behavior to enable modals within containers

v3.0.1
==================
* Adds the `px-modal-dismissed` event which is fired when the user closes
  the modal by pressing the escape key
* Adds the `disableCloseOnEscape` property which keeps the modal open when
  the user presses the escape key

v3.0.0
==================
Upgrades `<px-modal>` element and its related styles to support Polymer 1 and 2.
Refactors to simplify API and make the modal easier to implement in apps.

There are many major breaking changes in this release, please see below for more
information and an upgrade guide:

## Breaking change: Create the modal open trigger somewhere else in your app

The trigger the user taps to open the modal should no longer be passed in to
the `<px-modal>` component as a child. Create a trigger element somewhere else
in your application and data-bind a reference to your trigger to the new
`openTrigger` property on `<px-modal>`.

This is an example of the old deprecated way to define a trigger:

```
<px-modal>
  <button class="modal-trigger">Show modal</button>
</px-modal>
```

To upgrade to the new way, the above code should be changed to:

```
<!-- Inside a Polymer template -->
<px-modal open-trigger="[[modalTrigger]]"></px-modal>
-<px-modal-trigger trigger="{{modalTrigger}}">
  <!-- Mouse, touch, and keyboard events on this button show the modal -->
  <button>Show modal</button>
</px-modal-trigger>
```

You can also control the modal by updating the `opened` property. Setting it to
`true` opens the modal, and setting it to `false` closes the modal. Update the
`opened` property when the user performs an action that should show/hide the
modal if you want to control its visibility through properties alone.
For example:

```
<px-modal id="modal"></px-modal>
<button id="trigger">Show modal</button>
<script>
  var modal = document.getElementById('modal');
  var trigger = document.getElementById('trigger');
  trigger.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    modal.opened = true;
  }, false);
</script>
```

See the px-modal documentation for more information on using the new modal APIs.

## Breaking change: Properties renamed and removed, methods removed

* The `modalHeading` property is renamed to `headerText`
* The `btnModalPositive` property is renamed to `acceptText`
* The `btnModalNegative` property is renamed to `rejectText`
* The `modalId` property is deprecated and removed
* The `modalIdTitle()` method is deprecated and removed
* The `modalActionButtonClicked()` method is deprecated and removed
* The `modalButtonClicked()` method is removed, just set the `opened` property
  to `true` or `false` to show/hide the modal
* The `btnModalPositiveClickedEventName` and `btnModalNegativeClickedEventName`
  Properties are deprecated and removed, see migration tips below

## Breaking change: Custom event renaming removed, use new events

The `btnModalPositiveClickedEventName` and `btnModalNegativeClickedEventName`
properties have been removed, and custom event names can no longer be chosen.
The modal now fires the `px-modal-accepted` event when the user taps the
accept trigger and the `px-modal-rejected` event when the user taps the reject
trigger. To migrate, change your event listeners to catch these new events
and decide how to handle the action in your application code. If you want
to continue firing custom named events, you can attach an event listener to
`<px-modal>` in your app and fire a custom event manually when one of the
standard events are fired.

## Breaking change: CSS mixins removed

CSS mixins are deprecated because the browser vendors have decided not to move
forward with that specification. Search in your code and remove the following
mixins if they are used:

```
--px-modal
--px-modal-content
--px-modal-title
--px-modal-buttons
--px-modal-positive-button
```
